# Changelog

Notable changes to the `orca` plugin. Versions track
`plugins/orca/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-31

Initial scaffold. No skills yet — this release is the plugin skeleton and the
shared specs every skill will read.

**Plugin**

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — the `orca-skills` catalog, one plugin.
- `plugins/orca/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin identity at `0.1.0`.

**Shared specs** (`plugins/orca/skills/_shared/`)

| File | What it fixes in place |
|---|---|
| `github-backlog.md` | Milestone resolution, the one-call readiness query, `gh` constraints and gotchas. App-agnostic — GitHub only. |
| `agents-fragment.md` | The block `/orca:adopt` appends to a consuming repo's `AGENTS.md`, including the issue-schema and generated-roadmap rules. |
| `issue-schema.md` | **New.** The `### Done when` contract all five skills read — and the three buckets (command / diff assertion / human) that make a criterion checkable. |
| `orca-lanes.md` | **New.** Orca's identity and selector model, native lane fields, deletion safety, degraded mode, and the proven handoff invocation. |
| `evidence-gates.md` | **New.** How `/orca:verify` checks a criterion: evidence rules, verdicts, and the prohibition on guessing at human criteria. |

**Docs** — `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `TRACKING.md`.

**Two facts verified live against `orca` 1.4.162** that would otherwise have
shipped as defects:

- **Repo `displayName` does not track the directory name.** `--repo
  name:<dir-name>` returns a hard `repo_not_found`, not an empty result. Every
  skill resolves repos by `path:` or `id:`. Found by checking rather than
  trusting a planning document — the rule that requires this caught it.
- **The worktree ID key differs between commands.** `worktree list --json`
  returns it as `id`; `worktree ps --json` returns the same value as
  `worktreeId`. Reading the wrong key yields `undefined` and degrades silently.

**Design notes**

- Scope is five skills — `adopt`, `handoff`, `status`, `verify`, `plan` — plus
  one disabled-by-default automation. An adversarial review panel cut an earlier
  8-skill proposal on the grounds that most were wrappers over capability Orca
  already has; `adopt` was added back because the other four consume a tracking
  convention that nothing else establishes.
- **Skills are app- and project-agnostic.** No skill names a project, milestone,
  label, or acceptance criterion. Project-specific conventions live in the
  consuming repo.
- **The roadmap is generated and gitignored** — a rendering of GitHub state, so
  it cannot conflict and cannot drift.
